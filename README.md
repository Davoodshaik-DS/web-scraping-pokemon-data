## after making analysis
The proportion in the sample p^ is 30/40 => p^ = .75

The Z-score for the Sampling Distribution of proportions =

(p^ - P0) / Sqrt((P0 * (1-P0)) / n)

z = 0.75-0.3/Sqrt((0.3 * 0.7) / 40)

z = 6.21 standard deviations

The P-value for the z-score of 6.21 is nearly zero (~0)

Hence we can Reject the Null Hypothesis and Accept the Alternate Hypothesis
